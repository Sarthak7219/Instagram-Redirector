Instagram In-App Browser Redirector

This project provides a URL funneling service to bypass the Instagram in-app browser and redirect users to an external browser. The purpose is to enhance user experience and improve conversion rates by redirecting to a target URL, where users may already be logged in, outside the in-app environment.

Key Features:
- Redirects users to a specified external website from within the Instagram app.
- Detects the Instagram in-app browser and prompts users to open the link in a preferred external browser.
- Prevents the target site from loading if the user cancels the prompt, ensuring no loading within Instagram.

I used Javascript to implement the logic.
